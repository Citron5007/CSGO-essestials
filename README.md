# CSGO-essestials
My CSGO settings and config files all in one place, some macros are also set for anyone who wants to learn.
Just go into C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg and place your config files here
further go open steam, then go into CSGO settings and type the command  "+exec 'config-file-name.cfg" into the launch options bar
and the code in the config files should execute when you run the game. You can also do it manually by opening the console inside CSGO and typing the same command.
